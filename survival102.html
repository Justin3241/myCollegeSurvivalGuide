        <h1>Howework Block</h1>
        <p>I'm pretty sure everyone has experienced homework block before. You plan on being productive by studying for hour and doing homework. However, your brain takes a U-turn and is all like "How 'bout a NO, let's think about some unnecessary stuff for a while." So how would you deal with this? My best advice is to just GIVE UP.</p> 
        <p>No, really. Just give up and go for a walk. Relax your mind and let it wander wherever it wants and then do you homework. Simple as that.</p>
